What is a .onion site?
.onion sites (famous Silk Road) are not present in www but only in Tor network as it is a Tor hidden service. What is the use of it? .onion names are used to provide access to end to end encrypted, secure, anonymized services; that is, the identity and location of the server is obscured from the client.
